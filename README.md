# Synthesizing-of-3D-Model-for-Orthopedic-Insoles

A senior project of Computer Engineering students at Mahidol University (2023- 2024)

**Synthesizing of 3D-Model for Orthopedic Insoles** is a model that generates feet drawing from 3D scanned images for 3D printing orthopedic insoles. This project is planning on using *GANs* to do the mentioned task. The type of GANs we are currently interested in is [**pix2pix**](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) which we might try to implement the model on 3D images instead of using it with 2D images.
